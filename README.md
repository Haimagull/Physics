## Simulations
- Saturn's rings formation : This code is a simulation of the formation of Saturn's rings.
- Stellar stream gap + DM halos : This code is a simulation of stellar streams formation and dark matter (DM) halos effect on it (gaps). This is based on my previous work on modeling Saturn's rings' formation. This simulation aims to explain this phenomenon to neophytes.
